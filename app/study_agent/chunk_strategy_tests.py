Tamanna is a student of Grade 5. She has two chocolates of different sizes. She says that 1/3 of one of her chocolates is bigger than 1/2 of the other chocolate. Is that correct? Explain why this is so.

[Illustration: Two chocolate bars. The first is divided into two equal parts, with one part labeled "Identify 1/2 of the chocolate". The second is divided into three equal parts, with one part labeled "Identify 1/3 of the chocolate".]

When can we say that 1/2 of something is greater than 1/3 of something?

To compare two fractions of two wholes, the wholes from which the fractions are derived must be the same.
